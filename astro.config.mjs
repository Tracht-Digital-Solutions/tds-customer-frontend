  // This product was `output: "static"` until 2026-08-25, and the docs used to
  // forbid anything else on the grounds that the production host has no Node
  // runtime. That stopped being true on 2026-08-24, when the three public sites
  // moved to Astro SSR under Passenger (DEPLOY-PLESK.md §3.2).
  //
  // What server rendering buys here is an honest 404. The static deploy relied
  // on the vhost answering every unmatched path with the dashboard's
  // index.html — an SPA fallback that also answered *mis-resolved relative API
  // calls* with HTTP 200 and an HTML body, so `res.ok` was true, `res.json()`
  // threw, and the usual `.catch(() => setRows([]))` painted a calm, permanent
  // empty state with nothing logged anywhere.
  //
  // Two things it deliberately does NOT buy:
  //
  //  - NO page cache. The three public sites store each render as a file; a
  //    panel page is per-visitor. tds-shared/cache refuses a response carrying
  //    Set-Cookie and its cacheLocation cannot key on identity — a cache here
  //    would either store nothing or hand one visitor's page to the next.
  //  - NO server-side session check. The pre-paint gate in the host's
  //    Layout.astro stays exactly as it was: a client-side localStorage hint
  //    confirmed against /me behind a brand spinner. No Astro middleware, no
  //    Astro.cookies. Server rendering changed the deploy model, not the auth
  //    model.
